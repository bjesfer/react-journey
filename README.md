## 🎯 Learning Path

### For Beginners

If you're new to React, I recommend following this path:

1. **Start with React Basics** ⭐

   - Begin with **[React Overview](docs/0a_REACT_OVERVIEW.md)** to understand what React is, its core concepts (components, JSX, props, state, hooks), and how it works
   - This foundation is essential before diving into React Router

2. **Continue with the Documentation**

   - Read through the guides in order (Installation → Setup → Explanations)
   - Each guide builds upon the previous one

3. **Explore the Projects**

   - Begin with `00-first-react-app/`
   - Study the code structure and patterns
   - Try modifying and experimenting

4. **Practice**
   - Follow along with the examples
   - Create your own variations
   - Apply what you've learned

### For Experienced Developers

- Jump to specific topics in the documentation
- Review project implementations
- Use as reference for React Router v7 patterns
